# Overview

These guidelines outline curation processes for geospatial data and metadata in the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), and EarthWorks.

## Geospatial Data

Geospatial data is any type of data that directly or indirectly references a specific geographical area or location. Geospatial technology collects and analyzes the geospatial data. Geospatial data exists in either one of two formats, vector or raster. 

### Vector data 

Vector data are datasets with explicit coordinates and are represented as points, lines, or polygon features. SExamples of vector data are addresses (points), roads (lines), parcels (polygons). Shapefiles, GeoJSON.

### Raster data

Rasters, or coverages, are images whose edges have been given a geographic location. Examples of raster data are georeferenced maps or satellite images. TIFFs, ArcGRID, DEMs.

## Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure

The focus of the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI) is discoverability and dissemination of geospatial data. SSDI componenets are SDR, GeoServer, and EarthWorks. 


The following file formats are stored in SDR with both ISO and MODS metadata. These files are delivered through GeoServer:

* Shapefile
* GeoTIFF
* ArcGRID

All other file formats (geodatabases, geoPDFs, etc.) are stored in SDR with MODS metadata.
