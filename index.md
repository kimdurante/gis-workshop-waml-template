# Overview

These guidelines describe geospatial data curation and management operations for the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), and EarthWorks.

## Geospatial Data in SDR

Geospatial data are stored in the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), in either vector or raster format. Geospatial data are archived in SDR and made available for download, or accessed through Stanford's GeoServer using Web Mapping Services/Web Feature Services (WMS/WFS).

## EarthWorks

EarthWorks is Stanford's discovery portal for geospatial data and maps. This application is a branded implementation of GeoBlacklight, a community-driven software project focused on discovery and access of geographic information.
