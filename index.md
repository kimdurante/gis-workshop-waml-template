## Geospatial Data Management at SUL

These guidelines describe geospatial data curation and management operations for the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), and EarthWorks.

## Geospatial Data in SDR

Geospatial data are stored in SDR in either vector or raster format. Layers are made available for download and/or accessed using Web Mapping Services/Web Feature Services (WMS/WFS) facilitated by Stanford's GeoServer.

## EarthWorks

EarthWorks is Stanford's federated search catalog for geospatial data and maps. This application is implemented using GeoBlacklight, a community-driven software project focused on discovery and access of geographic information.
