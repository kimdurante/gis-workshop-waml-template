# Overview

These guidelines describe geospatial data management operations for the in the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), and EarthWorks.

## Geospatial Data

Geospatial data is any type of data that references a specific geographical area or location. Geospatial technology collects and analyzes the geospatial data. Geospatial data exists in either one of two formats, vector or raster. 

## Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure

The focus of the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI) is discoverability and dissemination of geospatial data. 

SSDI componenets are SDR, GeoServer, and EarthWorks. 

All other file formats (geodatabases, geoPDFs, etc.) are stored in SDR with MODS metadata.

## EarthWorks
