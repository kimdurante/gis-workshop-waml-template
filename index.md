## Geospatial Data Management at SUL ##

These guidelines describe geospatial data curation workflowa for the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), [EarthWorks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu) and [SearchWorks](https://searchworks.stanford.edu).

## Geospatial Data ## 

Geospatial data contain relative geographic information about a place and its features. 

### Types ###

Data are of two types - raster and vector. Raster data are composed of grid cells (rows and columns). Vector data contain points, lines, and polygons. 

### Formats ###

Geospatial data formats are containers that are used for encoding and exchagning geographic information. Data formats store and organize references relating to entities and events (locations, dates, etc.). Formats also determine how the data can be used. The [Geospatial Data workflows](https://github.com/sul-dlss/gis-robot-suite) at SUL currently accept the following formats:

- Shapefile 
- GeoTiFF
- ArcGRID

See [Format Descriptions for Geospatial Data](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/gis_fdd.shtml) for a list of geospatial data formats.
