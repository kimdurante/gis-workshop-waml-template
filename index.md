## Geospatial Data Management at SUL ##

These guidelines describe geospatial data curation and management operations for the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), EarthWorks and SearchWorks.

## EarthWorks ##

[EarthWorks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu) is Stanford's implementation of [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org), a multi-institutional open-source software project creating tools and best practices for finding and sharing spatial data and maps.

## Geospatial Data ## 

Geospatial data are of two types - raster and vector. Raster data are composed of grid cells identified by row and column. Vector data are composed of points, polylines, and polygons. Raster and vector data are containerized in one of many formats. The [GIS Data workflows](https://github.com/sul-dlss/gis-robot-suite) are currently configured to work with the following formats:

- Shapefile 
- GeoTiFF
- ArcGRID

See [Format Descriptions for Geospatial Data](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/gis_fdd.shtml) for a list of geospatial data foramts.
