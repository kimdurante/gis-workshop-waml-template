## Geospatial Data Management at SUL ##

These guidelines describe geospatial data curation workflowa for the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), [EarthWorks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu) and [SearchWorks](https://searchworks.stanford.edu).

## Geospatial Data ## 

Geospatial data contain relative geographic information about a place and its features. 

### Types ###

Geospatial data are of two types - raster and vector. Raster data are composed of grid cells (rows and columns). Vector data contain points, lines, and polygons. 

### Formats ###

Geospatial data formats are containers used for encoding and exchagning geographic information. Data formats store and organize references about entities and events (locations, dates, etc.).Formats also determine how the data can be used. The [Geospatial Data workflows](https://github.com/sul-dlss/gis-robot-suite) at SUL currently work with the following formats:

 * Shapefile 
   
   Shapefile is a widely-used format for vector data which can be read by almost all GIS systems. Shapefiles are comprised of at least 3 parts with same filename prefix and the following extensions: *.shp*, *.dbf*, *.shx*. Other files, such as *.prj* or *.cpg* may be present. All files must be saved in the same workspace (folder).
   
 * GeoTiFF
 * ArcGRID

See [Format Descriptions for Geospatial Data](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/gis_fdd.shtml) for a list of geospatial data formats.
