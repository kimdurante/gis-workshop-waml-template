## Creating Metadata

Creating metadata using a spreadsheet and scripts is usually faster and more efficient than creating metadata directly in ArcCatalog.

### Creating a Metadata Using a Spreadsheet

Copy the metadata management files (LINK) into the collection folder. Fill out the following fields in data.csv, leave the druid column blank.
