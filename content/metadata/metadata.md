## Creating Metadata

Creating metadata using a csv template and scripts is usually a faster and more efficient cataloging method. 
It is also possible to create metadata directly in ArcCatalog by following the instructions here.

### Creating a Metadata Using a Spreadsheet

Copy the files (XML and CSV templates) into the collection folder. Fill out data.csv, leaving the druid column blank.
