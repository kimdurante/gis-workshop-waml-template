## Creating a Collection

* All data layers must belong to at least one collection. The concept of a collection in GIS data management is somewhat vague, it might include data purchased from vendors, a set of georeferenced maps, open data downloaded from a website/portal, or scholarly research data. Collection objects in SDR do not store any data. They contain metadata and rights information which describe the collection contents at a generic level.


### Determining Rights - Administrative Policy Objects

* All collections and data layers must be governed by an Administrative Policy Object (APO). Locate the appropriate APO from [this list of Admin Policies](https://argo.stanford.edu/catalog/facet/nonhydrus_apo_title_ssim). If an appropriate APO does not currently exist [follow these instructions](https://consul.stanford.edu/display/DLSSDOCS/Argo+-+How+to+Create+an+APO) to create a new one.

### Creating a Collection Object

* Collection objects are described using either MARC or MODS metadata. If a MARC record already exists in WorkFlows, enhance the record as recommended and create a collection from the catKey. MARC metadata are transformed to MODS during creation.

* If no MARC record exists, create the collection using a title and description. Update the MODS after the object has accessioned.

* A Digital Repository Unique Identifier (DRUID) will be created for the collection.

### Collection-Level Metadata Recommendations

* In addition to common bibliographic elements (creator, publisher, subjects, publication date), the following MODS/MARC fields are recommended for collections:

|Field|MODS|MARC|Example|
|:-----|:------|:------|:------|
|Genre|genre authority="rdacontent"|336 (sub2='rdacontent')|cartographic dataset|
|Genre|genre authority="local"|655 (ind1='7'), (sub2='local')|Geographic information systems data|
|Genre|genre authority="lcgft"|655 (ind1='7'), (sub2='lcgft')|Geospatial data|
|Coordinates|subject/cartographics/coordinates|255|(W 121.4851--W 120.3878/N 038.0775--N 037.1347)|
