## Acquisitions Workflow

SUL acquires geospatial data from a number of sources, including:

* Commercial vendors
* Public data providers
* Scholarly research
* Special projects and support initiaitves

Data often are acquired as 'collections', meaning they contain multiple layers relating to a common theme, place, or event. It is crucial to understand what access and use restrictions apply before downloading and distributing data and may require consultation with the data provider or publisher. Rights information and other similarities amongst the data can sometimes be gathered by performing an assessment of the collection and/or examining files in a GIS.

## Assessment

Load all data into a folder named for the collection. Survey the collection to check for things such as: 
* total number of layers
* data types/formats
* file sizes
* supplemental files (codebooks or csv/text/PDF/html documents containing metadata and other information)

Consider: 
* What features do the data contain (population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery, etc.)? 
* Where they are located (geographic extent)? 
* When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)? 
* Who created and/or published the data? 
* How often are the data updated (edition/version)? 
* What are the access and use restrictions (rights)?
