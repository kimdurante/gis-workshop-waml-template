## Acquisitions Workflow

SUL acquires geospatial data from a number of sources, including commercial vendors, public data providers, researchers, and special projects. Data are usually acquired as 'collections,' meaning there are multiple data files relating a similar themes, places, events, etc. It is important to ascertain any copyright, access, and usage restrictions associated with the to the collection before downloading and distributing data. This may require consultation with the data provider or reading through website disclaimers/other documentation. 

## Collection Assessment

Move all data into a folder named for the collection. Survey the collection to check for things such as:

* total number of layers
* data types/formats
* file sizes
* supplemental files (codebooks, metadata, README, etc.)

In some cases it will be necessary to examine files in a GIS to understand the collection contents. 

Consider: 
* What features do the data contain (population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery, etc.)? 
* Where they are located (geographic extent)? 
* When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)? 
* Who created and/or published the data? 
* How often are the data updated (edition/version)? 
* What are the access and use restrictions (rights)?
