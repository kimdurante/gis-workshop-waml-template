## Acquisitions ##

SUL acquires geospatial data from a number of sources, including:

* Commercial vendors
* Public data providers
* Scholarly research
* Special projects and support initiaitves

Data often are acquired as 'collections', meaning they contain multiple layers relating to a common theme, place, or event. It is useful to identify these similarities by performing an assessment of the data and/or opening files in a GIS.

## Assessment

* Survey the contents of the collection to check for things such as: total number of layers, data types/formats, file sizes, and supplemental files (codebooks or csv/text/PDF/html documents containing metadata and other information)

* Consider: 
  * What features do the data contain (population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery, etc.)? 
  * Where they are located (geographic extent)? 
  * When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)? 
  * Who created and/or published the data? 
  * How often are the data updated (edition/version)? 
  * What are the access and use restrictions (rights)?
