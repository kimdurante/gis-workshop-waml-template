## Acquisitions Workflow

SUL acquires geospatial data from a number of sources, including commercial vendors, public data providers, researchers, and special projects (ex. cooperative cataloging partnerships). Data often are acquired as collections - meaning they contain multiple layers relating a similar theme, place, and/or event. During the acquisitions process, it is important to understand clearly what access and use restrictions apply to the collection before downloading and distributing data. This may require consultation with the data provider or reading through legal documentation on websites. 

## Assessment

Load all data into a folder named for the collection. Survey the collection to check for things such as: 
* total number of layers
* data types/formats
* file sizes
* supplemental files (codebooks or csv/text/PDF/html documents containing metadata and other information)

It may be necessary to examine files in a GIS.

Consider: 
* What features do the data contain (population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery, etc.)? 
* Where they are located (geographic extent)? 
* When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)? 
* Who created and/or published the data? 
* How often are the data updated (edition/version)? 
* What are the access and use restrictions (rights)?
