## Metadata

Creating metadata for geospatial data can be an extremely time-consuming process. Automation is recommended wherever possible, however workflow steps may vary depending on the complexities of the data.

### ISO 19139/19110 Metadata

* Metadata for vector and raster data are created in ArcCatalog using the ISO 19139 Metadata Specification. ISO 19110 Metadata describing feature catalogs (data attributes) are generated for vector data.

* Metadata for these layers are stored with the data in a manner that is appropriate for the data type. Metadata for shapefiles and geoTIFFs are recognizable by their file extensions _.shp.xml_ and _tif.xml_. Metadata for GRID files will always be named _metadata.xml_. 
 
* Metadata are output in the ArcGIS metadata format and transformed into ISO 19139, ISO 19110, MODS, and GeoBlacklight.

* Data and metadata are accessioned into SDR using [GIS Robot Workflows](https://github.com/sul-dlss/gis-robot-suite).

### MODS Metadata

* MODS metadata are created for all other file formats (geodatabases, geoPDFs, etc.) using either XML documents or a spreadsheet.

* Data are accessioned into SDR using the PreAssembly Application. 

### Web Applications

* JSON Metadata for web maps are stored here. These items are not accessioned into SDR.
