## Assessment

* Survey the contents of the data collection to check for things such as: total number of layers, type(s) of data, file sizes, and supplemental files (codebooks or csv/text/PDF/html documents containing metadata and other information)

* Consider: 
  * What features do the data contain (population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery, etc.)? 
  * Where they are located (geographic extent)? 
  * When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)? 
  * Who created and/or published the data? 
  * How often are the data updated (edition/version)? 
  * What are the access and use restrictions (rights)?

### Determining Rights - Administrative Policy Objects

* All collections and data layers must be governed by an Administrative Policy Object (APO). Locate the appropriate APO from [this list of Admin Policies](https://argo.stanford.edu/catalog/facet/nonhydrus_apo_title_ssim). If an appropriate APO does not currently exist [follow these instructions](https://consul.stanford.edu/display/DLSSDOCS/Argo+-+How+to+Create+an+APO) to create a new one.
